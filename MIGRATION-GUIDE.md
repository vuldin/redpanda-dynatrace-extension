# Migration Guide: Official → Enhanced Dynatrace Redpanda Extension

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Target**: Users migrating from official Dynatrace Hub extension to enhanced custom extension

---

## Why Migrate?

The enhanced extension is a complete superset of the official extension, providing:

- ✅ **ALL official metrics** including latency histograms with percentile support
- ✅ **2 additional unique critical metrics** (disk alert, RPC timeouts)
- ✅ **37 total metrics** vs 29 in official extension
- ✅ **100% feature parity** - no compromises
- ✅ **Open source** on GitHub - fully customizable
- ✅ **Community-driven** improvements and updates
- ✅ **Same metric names** - dashboards and alerts work without changes

---

## What You'll Gain

### New Unique Metrics
1. **`redpanda.storage.disk.free_space_alert`** - Binary disk alert (0=OK, 1=ALERT)
   - Better than threshold alerts on disk free bytes
   - Clear signal for "disk full" condition

2. **`redpanda.node.status.rpcs_timed_out`** - Node RPC timeout tracking
   - Detect node connectivity issues
   - Early warning for cluster network problems

### Enhanced Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Memory granularity**: Available, free, AND allocated (vs official: allocated only)
- **Detailed metrics**: All cluster topology, consumer group metadata, partition tracking

### Latency Monitoring with Percentiles
- **Kafka request latency histograms** with p50, p75, p90, p95, p99 support
- **RPC request latency histograms** with percentile queries
- Query example: `redpanda.kafka.request.latency.seconds_bucket.count:splitBy(redpanda_request):percentile(95.0)`

---

## What You'll Lose

### Nothing Critical!

The enhanced extension now provides **100% feature parity** with the official extension.

### Non-Critical Changes
- **Pre-built dashboards**: Official extension has overview dashboard - you'll need to rebuild (but all metrics are available)
- **Custom entity types**: Official creates namespace/topic/partition entities - enhanced uses dimensions

---

## Migration Decision Matrix

| Use Case | Recommendation | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **All production monitoring** | ✅ Migrate to Enhanced | 100% feature parity + unique critical metrics |
| **Production with latency SLAs** | ✅ Migrate to Enhanced | Full latency histogram support with percentiles |
| **Need customization** | ✅ Migrate to Enhanced | Open source, fully customizable |
| **Want latest updates** | ✅ Migrate to Enhanced | Community-driven, active development |
| **Cannot lose any metrics** | ✅ Migrate to Enhanced | Zero limitations - complete superset |

---

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Extension

Follow the deployment guide in [README.md](README.md) or [QUICK-DEPLOY-REFERENCE.md](QUICK-DEPLOY-REFERENCE.md).

**Quick summary:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/vuldin/redpanda-dynatrace-extension.git
cd redpanda-dynatrace-extension

# Install dt-cli
pipx install dt-cli

# Generate certificates
./scripts/setup-certificates-dtcli.sh

# Upload CA to Dynatrace Credential Vault
# (Settings → Credential Vault → Add Certificate → upload extension/certs/ca.pem)

# Copy CA to ActiveGate (if not Docker)
sudo cp extension/certs/ca.pem /var/lib/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/agent/conf/certificates/
sudo systemctl restart dynatracegateway

# Build and sign
./scripts/build-and-sign-dtcli.sh

# Upload dist/custom:redpanda.enhanced-1.0.8-signed.zip via Dynatrace UI
# (Custom Extensions Creator → Import)

# Configure monitoring
# (Extensions → custom:redpanda.enhanced → Add monitoring configuration)
# Endpoint: http://REDPANDA_HOST:9644/public_metrics
```

### Step 2: Enable Consumer Lag (Optional but Recommended)

If you were using consumer lag metrics in the official extension:

```bash
rpk cluster config set enable_consumer_group_metrics '["group", "partition", "consumer_lag"]'
```

### Step 3: Verify Metrics Collection (Wait 5 minutes)

In Dynatrace:
1. Navigate to **Metrics**
2. Search: `redpanda`
3. Expected: **37 metrics** visible

Compare counts:
- Official: 29 metrics
- Enhanced: 37 metrics

**Key metrics to verify:**
```
// Verify cluster topology
redpanda.cluster.brokers:avg()
redpanda.cluster.partitions:avg()
redpanda.cluster.topics:avg()

// Verify consumer group metadata
redpanda.kafka.consumer_group.consumers:splitBy(redpanda_group):avg()
redpanda.kafka.consumer_group.topics:splitBy(redpanda_group):avg()

// Verify unique critical metrics
redpanda.storage.disk.free_space_alert:max()
redpanda.node.status.rpcs_timed_out.count:rate()
```

### Step 4: Update Dashboards (If Needed)

**Good news**: All metric names are identical between official and enhanced!

**If you're using official dashboards:**
1. Export dashboard JSON from official extension dashboards
2. Import to Dynatrace (no changes needed to queries)
3. Verify all panels work

**If you built custom dashboards:**
- No changes needed - metric names unchanged
- Add new panels for unique metrics (disk alert, RPC timeouts)

### Step 5: Update Alerts

**Existing alerts:**
- Should work without changes (same metric names)
- Verify they're still active after migration

**Recommended new alerts:**
```dql
// P1: Disk full alert (unique to enhanced)
timeseries max(redpanda.storage.disk.free_space_alert) == 1

// P2: Node connectivity issues (unique to enhanced)
timeseries rate(redpanda.node.status.rpcs_timed_out.count) > 5/min

// All other alerts from official extension work unchanged
```

### Step 6: Remove Official Extension (Optional)

**Only after verifying enhanced works for 24-48 hours:**

1. Navigate to **Settings → Monitoring → Monitored technologies**
2. Find **Redpanda** extension
3. Click **Disable** or **Delete configuration**
4. Official extension stops collecting metrics

**Rollback plan**: If issues occur, re-enable official extension. Both can run simultaneously without conflict.

---

## Metric Mapping

All enhanced metrics have the same names as official (except unique metrics).

### Metrics That Are Identical (27)

These work exactly the same in both extensions:

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| **Partition Health** | `under_replicated_replicas`, `unavailable_partitions` |
| **Infrastructure** | `cpu.busy.seconds.total`, `memory.allocated.bytes`, `storage.disk.free.bytes`, `storage.disk.total.bytes`, `uptime.seconds.total` |
| **I/O Performance** | `io.queue.read.ops.total`, `io.queue.write.ops.total` |
| **Throughput** | `rpc.received.bytes`, `rpc.sent.bytes` |
| **Service Errors** | `rest_proxy.request.errors.total` |
| **Consumer Lag** | `consumer_group.committed_offset`, `consumer_group.lag.max`, `consumer_group.lag.sum` |
| **Cluster Topology** | `cluster.brokers`, `cluster.partitions`, `cluster.topics`, `kafka.replicas` |
| **Consumer Metadata** | `consumer_group.consumers`, `consumer_group.topics` |
| **Partition Tracking** | `kafka.max_offset` |
| **Application** | `application.build` |
| **RPC** | `rpc.active_connections`, `kafka.request.bytes.total` |

### Metrics Only in Enhanced (2)

| Metric | Purpose | Alert When |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `redpanda.storage.disk.free_space_alert` | Binary disk full indicator | == 1 |
| `redpanda.node.status.rpcs_timed_out` | Node connectivity issues | > threshold |

### Metrics Only in Official (4)

| Metric | Type | Limitation |
|--------|------|------------|
| `redpanda.kafka.request.latency.seconds` | Histogram | Platform cannot ingest |
| `redpanda.rpc.request.latency.seconds` | Histogram | Platform cannot ingest |

**Workaround**: Use I/O ops, throughput, CPU metrics as performance proxies.

## Troubleshooting Migration

### Issue: No Metrics Appearing

**Symptoms**: Metrics list is empty in Dynatrace

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Test Redpanda endpoint
curl http://REDPANDA_HOST:9644/public_metrics | head

# Check ActiveGate logs
sudo tail -100 /var/lib/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/log/remotepluginmodule.log | grep redpanda
```

**Common causes**:
1. Wrong endpoint: Must be `/public_metrics` not `/metrics`
2. Network issue: ActiveGate can't reach Redpanda on port 9644
3. Certificate not copied to ActiveGate
4. Extension status showing error

### Issue: Certificate Validation Failed

**Error**: "Extension signature is not valid"

**Fix**:
1. Upload `ca.pem` to Dynatrace Credential Vault
2. Copy to ActiveGate:
   ```bash
   sudo cp extension/certs/ca.pem /var/lib/dynatrace/remotepluginmodule/agent/conf/certificates/
   sudo systemctl restart dynatracegateway
   ```

### Issue: Consumer Lag Metrics Missing

**Symptoms**: `consumer_group.lag.max` and `consumer_group.lag.sum` not appearing

**Cause**: Redpanda doesn't expose lag by default

**Fix**:
```bash
rpk cluster config set enable_consumer_group_metrics '["group", "partition", "consumer_lag"]'
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for metrics to appear.

### ✅ Latency Histograms - RESOLVED in v1.0.10

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - All latency histogram metrics now working with percentile support.

**What's available**:
- Kafka request latency histograms (p50, p75, p90, p95, p99)
- RPC request latency histograms (p50, p75, p90, p95, p99)

**Query example**:
```
redpanda.kafka.request.latency.seconds_bucket.count:splitBy(redpanda_request):percentile(95.0)
```

## Performance Impact

### DDU Consumption

**Enhanced extension**:
- 37 metrics with standard scrape interval (1 minute)
- Estimated: 450-650 DDUs/hour (varies by cardinality)

**Comparison to official**:
- Similar consumption (official: 29 metrics)
- Enhanced has 8 additional metrics (2 unique + 6 latency histogram metrics)

**Recommendation**: Monitor DDU consumption for first 24 hours
- Settings → Monitoring consumption
- Check "Custom metrics" usage

### ActiveGate Load

**No significant difference** from official extension:
- Same scrape interval (1 minute)
- Same endpoint (`/public_metrics`)
- Similar metric count (31 vs 29)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur during migration:

### Option 1: Keep Enhanced, Re-Enable Official (Run Both)

1. Keep enhanced extension deployed
2. Re-enable official extension in monitoring settings
3. Both extensions run simultaneously (no conflict)
4. Debug enhanced extension issue
5. Disable official again when resolved

**Downside**: Increased DDU consumption (both extensions collecting)

### Option 2: Remove Enhanced, Revert to Official Only

1. Delete enhanced extension in Custom Extensions Creator
2. Keep official extension enabled
3. Lose unique critical metrics (disk alert, RPC timeouts)
4. Report issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/vuldin/redpanda-dynatrace-extension/issues)

**A**: Yes! There's no conflict. Both will collect metrics independently. However, this increases DDU consumption.

**Use case**: Run both during migration testing period, then disable official after verification.

### Q: Will my dashboards break?

**A**: No. All metric names are identical (except 2 new unique metrics). Dashboards work without changes.

### Q: What if I need latency metrics?

**A**: ✅ **RESOLVED in v1.0.10** - Enhanced extension now has full latency histogram support with percentile queries (p50, p75, p90, p95, p99).

**Query syntax**:
```
redpanda.kafka.request.latency.seconds_bucket.count:splitBy(redpanda_request):percentile(95.0)
```

### Q: Is enhanced extension officially supported by Dynatrace?

**A**: No. Enhanced is a community-driven custom extension (open source on GitHub). Official extension is supported by Dynatrace.

**Benefit**: Faster updates, community contributions, full customization.

### Q: How do I update enhanced extension?

**A**: Follow update guide in [REDPANDA-USER-GUIDE.md](REDPANDA-USER-GUIDE.md):
1. Delete old version in Custom Extensions Creator
2. Build new version: `./scripts/build-and-sign-dtcli.sh`
3. Upload new signed ZIP
